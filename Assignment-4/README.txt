# Parameters
episodes = 10   # No. of episodes
alpha = 0.5     # Learning rate
gamma = 0.9     # Discount Factor
epsilon = 0.1   # Value of epsilon
eps_flag = 0    # For third case, Epsilon converges to 0 with time when value is 1
greedy = 0  	# For fourth case, Greedy policy for action i.e. always choose best action based on Q-value when value is 1
