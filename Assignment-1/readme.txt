All the algorithm files are kept in path "AI_Assignment_1_2020/cair_maze/" and "".


For Q1 to Q4
Name of files are :
"pathfinding_bfs.py", "pathfinding_dfs.py", "pathfinding_ucs.py", "pathfinding_Astar.py"

To run the code just rename the file as "pathfinding.py" & run the file "example_2.py" present in "AI_Assignment_1_2020/example/" path.

NOTE : Don't forget to rename the file name to its original name before renaming the next code to "pathfinding.py" to run.




To run the Q5:

Install the environment using commands: (where setup file is present)("New Environment code 2019CSM1008")

pip install gym
pip install pygame==2.0.0.dev6
python3 -m pip3 install -U pygame --user
pip install -e . --user

Now "gym-sliding-puzzle-master/gym_sliding_puzzle/envs/" contain the file named "pathfinding.py", which contain code to find path.
To run the code: go to "gym-sliding-puzzle-master/" & run "example.py"
